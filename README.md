To-Do List v3.0 - This app is a simple To-Do List manager for day to day business. 
You can add items using the input bar on the bottom of the screen and remove items by long-clicking them. 
The app stores the data internally so your To-Do List gets saved and can be reaccessed later. 
You can switch between lists by using the navigation drawer.

In this version the datastructures have been updated and also a check function is added for the list items.
However the check function is not yet working properly, because of the usage of a normal ArrayAdapter. 
Because of time issues I have not been able to totally use the data structures by designing a custom Adapter.
Therefore the checked function has been commented out, because it interferes with the long-press function.
